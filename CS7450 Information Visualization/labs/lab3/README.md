> This lab will cover D3 scales and axes. **It is expected that you understand the basics of D3.** That includes d3-selections, how to make a simple data-binding with d3 (i.e. `.data().enter().append()`), and how to declare attributes and styles for DOM elements based on bound data (i.e. `.style('fill', '#333')` and `.attr('x', 80)`). This material can all be found in the [Lab 2 - Intro to D3](https://github.gatech.edu/CS-7450/Fall-2020-Labs/wiki/Lab-2:-Intro-to-D3).
